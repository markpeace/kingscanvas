# King’s Canvas

**King’s Canvas** is a digital life-design tool developed for students at King’s College London. It empowers students to identify their long-term goals (called **intentions**), break them down into actionable **steps**, and discover real-world **opportunities** — from King’s Edge programs, student societies, courses, and more — to help bring those goals to life.

This is a structured but creative space where students can map out their ambitions from now through to life after graduation, with support from AI and real-time data integrations.

## 🚀 Core Features

- 🧭 **Intentions** — Students define their aspirations, such as *“Become a teacher”* or *“Start a business.”*
- 🪜 **Steps** — Each intention is broken into practical, time-boxed steps.
- 📌 **Canvas Board** — A visual organiser using four timeline buckets:
  - Do Now
  - Do Later
  - Do Before I Graduate
  - Do After I Graduate
- 🤖 **AI Assistance** — Contextual suggestions for steps and opportunities, tailored to each user’s evolving plan.
- 💡 **Live Opportunity Matching** — Background service recommends relevant activities based on plan content and eligibility.

intent: "Resolve the ping graph type errors breaking the deployment build."
inputs:
  - "Adjust lib/ai/graph/ping.ts to satisfy LangGraph channel typings while preserving error handling."
  - "Run the build to confirm the ping API compiles."
  - "Update state, roadmap status, and logging to reflect the fix."
plan:
  - "Restore LangGraph channel declarations with explicit null defaults."
  - "Compile the graph using the builder entry/finish points to avoid runtime errors."
  - "Record the successful fix in state and status docs, then log this prompt."
success_criteria:
  - "npm run build completes without type or runtime errors."
  - "lib/ai/graph/ping.ts contains valid channel configuration and builder usage."
  - "State and roadmap documents capture the new prompt and timestamp."

Summary:
Fixed the ping graph builder configuration so the channels align with LangGraph's typings, reinstated explicit entry/finish points,
and verified the project builds successfully.

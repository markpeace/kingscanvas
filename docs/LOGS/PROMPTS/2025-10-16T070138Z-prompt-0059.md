intent: "Resolve the deployment type error preventing the forms demo build."
inputs:
  - "Investigate the Vercel build failure complaining that default agree: false violates the z.literal(true) schema."
  - "Adjust the agree field schema so the form can initialise unchecked while still requiring acceptance on submit."
  - "Verify type checks pass locally."
  - "Update state tracking docs upon completion."
plan:
  - "Reproduce the type error locally to confirm the failure."
  - "Modify the Zod schema to allow boolean defaults while enforcing true on validation."
  - "Run lint/type checking to ensure the issue is resolved."
  - "Refresh logs and state metadata for the prompt execution."
success_criteria:
  - "Agree checkbox can default to false without violating the schema type."
  - "`next build` (via type checking) no longer fails on the forms demo page."
  - "Documentation accurately reflects the new prompt execution."

PR 3 Final Hotfix: LangChain removal and PR-2 model enforcement

## Notes
- Removed LangChain usage from the step-generation workflow and routed step
  prompts through the PR-3 prompt with PR-2 model enforcement.
- Simplified response parsing to use native OpenAI responses and preserved
  model provenance in returned suggestions.
- Follow-up actions:
  - None.

## Validation
- command: npm run lint -- --file lib/langgraph/workflow.ts
  outcome: passed
  notes: Lint clean after LangChain removal and PR-2 model enforcement
- command: scripts/validate_docs.sh
  outcome: passed
  notes: Placeholder validation script (schemas to be added later)

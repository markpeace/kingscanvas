intent: "Resolve the build regression caused by the new form helper typings."
inputs:
  - "Preserve react-hook-form generic inference when spreading UseFormReturn into the Form component."
  - "Adjust the withSubmit helper to satisfy react-hook-form's FieldValues constraint."
  - "Verify that the Next.js build, including forms-demo, compiles without type errors."
plan:
  - "Alias the Form export to FormProvider to retain generic typing."
  - "Constrain withSubmit to FieldValues and propagate the type through the runner helper."
  - "Run npm run build to confirm the Vercel failure is resolved."
  - "Record this prompt execution and refresh state metadata."
success_criteria:
  - "Next.js build completes without the previous type errors."
  - "Form helper typings no longer conflict with typed UseFormReturn values."
  - "Logs and state documents capture this prompt."

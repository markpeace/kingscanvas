intent: Ship the minimal debug panel scaffold with sink, log helper, and layout wiring
inputs:
  - Create components/debug/sink.ts with an in-memory pub/sub sink.
  - Create components/debug/DebugPanel.tsx with the minimal UI.
  - Create lib/debug/log.ts with helper to push entries.
  - Overwrite app/layout.tsx to conditionally load the debug panel when enabled.
  - Update state, status, and roadmap logs per protocol.
plan:
  - Switch to branch `epoch-0004-debug-panel` and add the debug sink, panel UI, and log helper.
  - Wire the debug panel into the root layout behind the DEBUG_PANEL_ENABLED flag.
  - Refresh state, roadmap status, and prompt logs; prepare the PR summary.
success_criteria:
  - New debug sink, panel, and log helper files match the provided content.
  - app/layout.tsx conditionally renders the debug panel only when DEBUG_PANEL_ENABLED=true.
  - Repository state and roadmap docs reflect epoch-0004 progress and the new PR.

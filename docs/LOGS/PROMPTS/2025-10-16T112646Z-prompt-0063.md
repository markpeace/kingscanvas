intent: "Add seed unit tests for UI Button and useZodErrorFor hook plus document quick test commands."
inputs:
  - "Create test/ui/button.test.tsx with coverage for rendering, variants, and disabled state."
  - "Create test/forms/useZodErrorFor.test.tsx exercising validation messaging lifecycle."
  - "Append quick-run guidance to docs/TESTING/README.md."
  - "Update state trackers and epoch status after execution."
plan:
  - " author the requested test files under test/ui and test/forms."
  - " append the quick check section to testing documentation."
  - " run focused jest suite to verify new specs (note repository tooling requirements)."
  - " log the prompt, refresh CURRENT.yaml and STATUS.yaml with latest timestamp, and prepare PR summary."
success_criteria:
  - " Button test ensures children render, variants map to classes, and disabled state holds."
  - " useZodErrorFor test demonstrates error message display and clearing with valid input."
  - " Testing README includes quick commands for running suites and coverage."
  - " State files and prompt logs reflect this execution."
side_effects:
  - " Jest execution currently requires ts-node which is not installed; document any run limitations."

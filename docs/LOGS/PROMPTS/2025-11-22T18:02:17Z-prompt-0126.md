Fix suggest-step model type for PR-3 hotfix build

## Notes
- Switched the suggest-step workflow to use a non-null model string when
  invoking the OpenAI responses API, keeping PR-2 enforcement intact and
  preserving PR-3 prompt tracing.
- Recorded the PR log update for the follow-up fix and re-ran lint/build checks
  to verify the type error is resolved (build currently blocked by missing
  OPENAI_API_KEY in the environment).

## Validation
- command: npm run lint -- --file lib/langgraph/workflow.ts
  outcome: pass
  notes: ""
- command: CI=1 npm run build
  outcome: blocked
  notes: "Fails in this environment because OPENAI_API_KEY is not set"
- command: scripts/validate_docs.sh
  outcome: pass
  notes: "Placeholder validation script runs"

## Summary
- Added the `/api/steps/[stepId]/opportunities/shuffle` alias so the shuffle POST matches the documented path and updated the StepCard fetcher accordingly.
- Verified the modal interactions with new tests that open the portal, click Close, and exercise the shuffle control end-to-end via the mocked API.

## Notes
- Follow-up actions:
  - None.

## Validation
- command: npm test -- --runTestsByPath test/ui/StepCard.test.tsx

## Summary
- Removed the legacy Pages Router intentions API to clear the Next.js conflict so the new App Router handler can ship.

## Notes
- Follow-up actions:
  - Monitor the first deploy after this change to ensure `/api/intentions` traffic is handled exclusively by the App Router route.

## Validation
- command: CI=1 MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/test npm run build
  outcome: passed-with-warnings
  notes: "Build succeeds once the legacy Pages route is removed; MongoDB connection errors are expected locally because no dev instance is running."

intent: "Resolve the /ui-demo/forms prerender error caused by accessing useFormContext before the provider renders."
inputs:
  - "Investigate the Vercel build failure citing formState destructuring on null from useFormContext."
  - "Adjust the demo form page so useZodErrorFor executes within a FormProvider context."
  - "Maintain existing UI behavior and styles while restoring static generation."
plan:
  - "Review app/ui-demo/forms/page.tsx to confirm how useZodErrorFor is invoked."
  - "Refactor error message rendering into a child component that reads the hook inside the provider."
  - "Run the build command locally (expecting next CLI missing) to mirror CI and document the outcome."
success_criteria:
  - "The forms demo no longer calls useFormContext outside a provider during prerender."
  - "Static generation succeeds downstream once Next.js can evaluate the component."
  - "Form error messages retain their prior presentation, including spacing adjustments."
side_effects:
  - "None."

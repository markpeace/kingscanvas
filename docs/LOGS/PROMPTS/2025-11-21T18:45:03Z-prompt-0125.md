Instrument runtime suggest-steps logging

## Notes
- Created runtime workflow instrumentation to log the active LLM model and prompt for suggest-steps.
- Added an LLM configuration guard that reports errors to both debug sinks before throwing.

## Validation
- command: not run (not requested)
  outcome: not_run
  notes: "Logging-only change; tests not requested."

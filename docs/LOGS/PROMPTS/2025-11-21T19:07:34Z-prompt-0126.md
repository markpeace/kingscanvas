Hotfix instrumentation for generate-next-step workflow and LLM core

## Notes
- Added LLM configuration enforcement and debug instrumentation for the generate-next-step workflow and LLM core client.
- Logged active model and prompts to both server and client debug sinks.

## Validation
- command: npm test
  outcome: failed
  notes: "Suite fails in this environment due to existing test issues (Playwright invoked under Jest, missing providers, and test expectations)."

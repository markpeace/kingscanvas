intent: "Fix the guarded LangGraph helper so the project passes type checking during builds."
inputs:
  - "Resolve the TypeScript error reported during npm run build for lib/ai/graph/guarded.ts."
  - "Maintain existing guarded behavior with LangGraph-first execution and direct fallback."
  - "Update state and status documentation and append this execution log."
plan:
  - "Inspect the guarded LangGraph helper implementation to identify the failing type signature."
  - "Adjust the StateGraph configuration to satisfy TypeScript while preserving runtime semantics."
  - "Run linting to confirm the fix and document the execution in state and roadmap files."
success_criteria:
  - "npm run build no longer fails because of the guarded helper TypeScript error."
  - "LangGraph execution still compiles and invokes correctly with explicit channels."
  - "Repository state files reflect prompt-0050 as the current active work."

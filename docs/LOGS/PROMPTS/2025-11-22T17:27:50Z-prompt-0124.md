Fix suggest-step model enforcement type error

## Notes
- Updated suggest-step workflow to use the enforced model string when calling
  the PR-2 OpenAI client, eliminating a type error during build.
- Follow-up actions:
  - None.

## Validation
- command: npm run lint -- --file lib/langgraph/workflow.ts
  outcome: passed
  notes: lint clean after model type fix
- command: npm run build
  outcome: blocked
  notes: "Fails locally because OPENAI_API_KEY is not set in this environment"

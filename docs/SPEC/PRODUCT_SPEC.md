# Product Specification — King’s Canvas

---

## 1. Product Summary

**King’s Canvas** is a digital life-design platform built for students at King’s College London. It empowers students to plan their university journey and beyond by surfacing personal **intentions**, breaking them down into actionable **steps**, and connecting them to real **opportunities** drawn from King’s Edge, student societies, and other university resources.

The tool blends freeform planning with AI-guided suggestions and automated opportunity-matching, all wrapped in a visually intuitive interface.

## 2. Problem Statement

Students often struggle to:
- Articulate long-term goals while navigating short-term university decisions.
- Find relevant opportunities that align with their interests and availability.
- Build a sense of momentum or purpose throughout their time at King’s.

Current systems are fragmented and reactive. King’s Canvas provides a proactive, student-centred planning surface that connects goals with action.

---

## 3. Goals

- Provide a canvas-based planning interface to help students visualise their personal and professional growth across time.
- Support students in defining long-term **intentions** and breaking them into clear **steps**.
- Match opportunities (programs, workshops, societies, experiences) to those steps using AI-assisted logic.
- Enable a flexible blend of manual and AI-generated planning.
- Track engagement over time and surface insights to staff and mentors (Phase 2+).

## 4. Core Features

### ✳ Intentions
- Defined by the student or suggested via AI chat.
- Represent high-level ambitions or outcomes.
- Must be assigned to a future time bucket:
  - Do Before I Graduate
  - Do After I Graduate

### ✳ Steps
- Practical tasks connected to an Intention.
- Assigned to a current or near-future bucket:
  - Do Now
  - Do Later
- May include tags (skills, focus areas) to improve recommendation relevance.
- Can be generated by the user or the system.

### ✳ Canvas Board
- Kanban-style interface divided into four horizontal buckets:
  - Do Now → Do Later → Before Graduation → After Graduation
- Intentions and steps are represented as draggable cards.
- Each Intention anchors a “swim lane” of steps flowing backwards from its assigned time bucket.

### ✳ Opportunity Matching Engine
- Runs in the background after plan edits or on a schedule.
- Matches opportunities (courses, events, activities) to steps using:
  - Tags
  - Eligibility (e.g., year of study, faculty, programme)
  - Availability (e.g., time of year, deadlines)
- Each Step card shows a numeric badge if matches exist.
- Students can:
  - Accept (link to step)
  - Dismiss (suppress)
  - Snooze (resurface later)

### ✳ AI Chat Assistant
- Natural language interface that supports:
  - Generating or refining Intentions.
  - Suggesting Steps for a given Intention.
  - Providing explanation for why an opportunity was matched.
- Suggestions are never forced — always accept/rejectable.
- Learns from rejected/snoozed actions.

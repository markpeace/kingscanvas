# 2025-11-15 — Epoch 0008 "Opportunity AI Simulation"

## Summary
- Delivered simulated King’s Edge style opportunities for every real step (manual or accepted AI) while ghost suggestions remain untouched.
- Added shuffle controls plus `GET`/`POST` API surfaces so students can refresh and load opportunities reliably.
- Updated the ear badge and Opportunities modal to show counts, Edge vs independent groupings, shuffle, close, and viewport-safe scrolling.
- Landed structured logging along with unit and integration tests to cover the generator, eligibility logic, and API endpoints.

## Deferred / Next
- Real King’s Edge API integration will occur in Epoch 0009 once contracts and governance reviews are ready.
- Additional copy/prompt refinement is deferred until live data can inform tone and specificity.

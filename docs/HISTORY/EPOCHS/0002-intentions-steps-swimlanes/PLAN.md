# Epoch 0002 — Intentions, Steps & Swim Lanes

## Objective
Deliver an interactive Canvas that allows students to organise Intentions and their associated Steps with full CRUD controls and drag-and-drop swim lanes.

## Scope
- Model Intentions and Steps as linked entities rendered on the Canvas.
- Provide creation, editing, and deletion flows for both Intentions and Steps.
- Implement drag-and-drop so Steps can move between time buckets and Intentions can be rearranged.
- Introduce responsive layout, accessibility refinements, and performance improvements needed for daily use.

## Milestones & Notable PRs
- 0001–0004: Established data models, rendering logic, and reliable drag-and-drop interactions.
- 0005–0009: Added modal-based CRUD workflows, accessibility polish, and header alignment.
- 0010–0014: Delivered distinct visual styling, trash-zone interactions, and cross-bucket Intention moves.
- 0015–0020: Final spacing, responsiveness, toasts, and drag-to-trash optimisations.
- 0020-hotfix series: Stabilised deletion flows and collision priorities.

## Exit Criteria
- Students can create, edit, move, and delete Intentions and Steps.
- Drag-and-drop behaves predictably across breakpoints with responsive layout.
- Accessibility checks pass and feedback toasts confirm user actions.

# Roadmap — King’s Canvas

This roadmap outlines the development epochs for **King’s Canvas**. Each epoch is a focused, user-visible slice that moves the product closer to the long-term vision: helping King’s College London students map intentions, actionable steps, and real-world opportunities.

Detailed implementation plans for each epoch live under `/docs/ROADMAP/EPOCHS/<epoch-slug>/`.

---

## 🧭 Overview

- **Product Vision:** Students use King’s Canvas to design their life journey, breaking intentions into steps and connecting them to actionable opportunities.
- **Approach:** Ship incrementally through tightly scoped epochs, keeping documentation, state, and UX in sync at every milestone.

---

## 📅 Epoch Timeline

### ✅ Epoch 0001 — Canvas Columns and Layout
**Status:** Completed.

Established the four-column Canvas layout (Do Now / Do Later / Before I Graduate / After I Graduate), applied King’s branding and accessibility foundations, and delivered a responsive static prototype for review.

---

### ✅ Epoch 0002 — Intentions, Steps and Swim Lanes
**Status:** Completed.

Added CRUD flows, drag-and-drop swim lanes, card styling, accessibility affordances, and feedback toasts so students can manage intentions and steps interactively.

---

### ✅ Epoch 0003 — Authentication and Session Handling
**Status:** Completed.

Implemented Google OAuth via NextAuth, route guards, session UI, and local/preview bypasses to secure the Canvas while supporting rapid iteration.

---

### ✅ Epoch 0004 — Persistence and Autosave
**Status:** Completed.

Connected the Canvas to MongoDB with autosave, background sync reliability, and debug instrumentation so edits persist automatically across sessions.

---

### ✅ Epoch 0005 — LangGraph AI Step Suggestions
**Status:** Completed.

Integrated LangGraph workflows to generate suggested steps, added prompt builder iterations, and refined the UX for reviewing, accepting, or rejecting AI-generated steps.

---

### ✅ Epoch 0006 — Roadmap and UX Refresh
**Status:** Completed. ([PLAN](./EPOCHS/0006-roadmap-ux-refresh/PLAN.md))

Delivered: Synced STATE and ROADMAP artefacts, refreshed changelog coverage,
and shipped Canvas UX polish across layout, modals, saving feedback, and
drag-and-drop cues informed by Epoch 0005 learnings.

---

### ✅ Epoch 0007 — Opportunities Model and UI
**Status:** Completed. ([STATUS](./EPOCHS/0007-opportunities-model-ui/STATUS.yaml))

- **Model:** Opportunity entity linked to steps with source, form, focus, and status metadata.
- **Storage & API:** Persistence layer and `GET /api/steps/[stepId]/opportunities` endpoint for read-only access.
- **UI:** Opportunity badges on real step cards and a modal with loading, empty, and populated states. Ghost AI suggestions intentionally omit opportunity UI.

---

### ✅ Epoch 0008 — Opportunity AI Simulation
**Status:** Completed. ([STATUS](./EPOCHS/0008-opportunity-ai-simulation/STATUS.yaml))

- Shipped simulated King’s Edge style opportunities for every real step, with eligibility rules scoped to manual and accepted AI steps.
- Added shuffle controls and API support so students can refresh suggestions on demand.
- Updated the ear badge and modal UI to show counts plus Edge vs independent groupings with reliable scrolling and controls.
- Hardened the flow with structured logging, error handling, and tests covering the generator, eligibility, and endpoints.

---

### 🧠 Epoch 0009 — Future Real Edge Integration
**Status:** In planning.

Connect to real King’s Edge data sources, handle secure data exchange, and graduate the simulated opportunity experience into production-ready integrations once data governance clears the path.

---

### 🚧 Epoch 0010 — Prompt Refinement and AI Architecture
**Status:** In progress. ([PLAN](./EPOCHS/0010-prompt-refinement/PLAN.md))

Enforce explicit LLM selection with Debug Panel visibility, consolidate and contextualise the step and opportunity prompts, and thread student context through UI, API, and prompts to keep AI guidance transparent and trustworthy.

---

## 🧩 Supporting Workstreams

Ongoing parallel streams ensure each epoch ships responsibly:

- **Brand & UX Alignment:** Continual collaboration with King’s Brand and Marketing for visual consistency.
- **Accessibility (WCAG AA+):** Verification and remediation alongside each feature shipment.
- **Security & GDPR:** Privacy and compliance reviews for authentication, data storage, and AI workflows.
- **Documentation & Observability:** Keep `/docs/STATE/`, `/docs/ROADMAP/`, and debug tooling up to date as functionality evolves.

---

## ✅ Definition of Done (MVP)

The King’s Canvas MVP is complete when:

1. Students can authenticate, create, and manage a persistent Canvas.
2. AI workflows generate, match, and explain suggestions with actionable insights.
3. Opportunity discovery and conversational coaching are available, brand-compliant, and accessible.
4. The platform is production-ready, observability is in place, and compliance requirements are satisfied.

# Epoch 0006 — Roadmap & UX Refresh

**Parent Project:** King’s Canvas  \
**Epoch ID:** 0006  \
**Branch:** `feature/epoch-0006/roadmap-ux-refresh`  \
**Status:** In Planning

---

## 🎯 Overview & Goals

Bring the project documentation and lightweight UX polish back into alignment after the LangGraph AI work of Epoch 0005. This epoch focuses on ensuring our STATE and ROADMAP artefacts are truthful and that the Canvas experience reflects the most recent feedback.

---

## 🗂️ Planned Work Items

1. **Sync STATE & ROADMAP** — Update `/docs/STATE/CURRENT.yaml` and `/docs/ROADMAP/ROADMAP.md` so they describe Epochs 0001–0009 accurately, marking 0005 complete and establishing 0006 as the active effort.
2. **Canvas UX Refresh** — Apply light UX and layout refinements to the Canvas surface (copy, spacing, affordances) to address issues noted during Epoch 0005 playtesting.
3. **Documentation Hygiene** — Ensure the new epoch folder contains PLAN and STATUS scaffolding for consistent traceability.

---

## 🔗 Dependencies

- Outputs from **Epoch 0005 — LangGraph AI Step Suggestions** provide the latest product context for documentation and UX decisions.
- Any Canvas UX adjustments must remain compatible with the autosave and AI suggestion flows introduced in earlier epochs.

---

## 🚧 Out of Scope

- Building the opportunities data model or RAG pipelines (deferred to Epochs 0007–0008).
- Adding new AI workflows beyond the documentation alignment.
- Major visual redesigns or brand updates beyond the light polish described above.

---

## ✅ Exit Criteria

- STATE and ROADMAP artefacts reflect Epoch 0006 as current and enumerate future epochs through 0009.
- PLAN and STATUS files for Epoch 0006 are populated and linked from ROADMAP.
- Documented UX polish items are implemented or explicitly deferred with rationale captured in STATUS updates.

summary: |
  Epoch 0007 — Opportunities Model & UI delivered the opportunity domain model,
  persistence, read-only API, and real-step UI badge plus modal for real steps.
  Epoch 0008 — Opportunity AI Simulation is now underway to generate fictional
  King’s Edge style opportunities whenever real steps are created or accepted
  from AI suggestions, add shuffle controls, and keep ghost suggestions free of
  opportunities.
